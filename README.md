# Logistic Regression for Predicting Purchase Behavior

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their gender, age, and estimated salary.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Estimated Salary**: The estimated annual salary of the customer.
- **Purchased**: The target variable indicating whether the customer made a purchase (1) or not (0).

## Objectives
1. Understand the relationship between customer demographics and purchase behavior.
2. Build a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on the given features.
3. Evaluate the performance of the model and interpret the results.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
